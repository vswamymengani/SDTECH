              <p id="a22">School Management System helps Management to get the most accurate information to make more effective decisions. Teachers and headmasters gain time saving administrative tools, parents gain immediate access to their children’s grades and students can track their own progress.

                        and form letters in just a few clicks. <br></br><br></br>

              School Management Systems helps Teachers to complete grade book, track students' attendance, input class notes, create lesson plans and detailed reports, and communicate with other staff members, students, and parents all via e-mail.  
              <br></br>
              School Management System (SMS) also helps Students/Parents to access assignments and tests, and view attendance records, grades, report cards, and progress reports all online. <br></br><br></br>They  also can communicate through mail and forums with teachers and other students online.

           SMS is a web and mobile enabled application developed in React native and powerful MYSQL/PgAdmin database backend. To implement My School application, schools do not need expensive hardware and software, they just need an internet connection and desktops. Our system works as a centralized database and application that schools can easily access the system from anywhere based on the login credentials. My School is a platform independent system that virtually any user can access from anywhere through a standard internet accessible system.
           We can also customize School for individual school needs.

      <div id="a24"><h1>Introduction</h1>
           <p id="a30">Nowadays, education plays a great in development of any country. Many of education organizations try to increase education quality. One of the aspects of this improvement is managing of school resources.<br></br><br></br>
               Our system is a major tool through this managing process by making a continuous communication between Management, teacher, parents and student. So, to achieve that goal, we need a Web and mobile app that covers the needs of all users at the same time.  <br></br><br></br>

               <b>For Management,</b> they have a full control on the system, like they can add a new parents, teachers and students with their subjects. <br></br><br></br>
                <b>For Teachers,</b> they can add student’s grades or edit it for their own subjects only, and they have a direct connection with students and their parents . <br></br><br></br>
                 <b>For Parents,</b> they have an access for their sons/daughters' grades without any possibility to edit on it, and they can directly contact with teachers and headmasters. All the system users can publish whatever they need within the educational process on the last updates section, and these posts is visible for all the users .<br></br><br></br>
                    <b>For Students,</b> they can view their subject's grades, contact with the headmaster and teachers for any complaint, recommendation or an absence permission, and they also up to date with all school's news or posts that publish by the other users.

                    <h1 id="a26">Problem Statement</h1>
                   
                  <p id="a31">The academic achievement for many students has decline, because of lake of care of them from their parents, 
                        and this refer to that their parents do not have a free time to come to school . <br></br><br></br>
                     Management and Teachers are facing problems at the start of every new academic year, because of distribution process for courses and classes, in addition to this , through and at the end of every year another problem is facing them, which is the complexities of the grade's entry process for their students . Lack of communication after a school day between Management, Teachers, Parents and Students, which has a bad reflection on the educational process.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                      <b>Motivation:</b><br></br><br></br>
                   The importance of school education lies in the fact that the children of today will become adult citizens of tomorrow.<br></br><br></br>
                      The growth and future of our country highly depends upon the quality of the present school education system. And in a good school the chief objective is to stimulate interest and curiosity in the students and provide all possible facilities for headmasters, teachers and parents to achieve the desired goal which is a better and easier educational ways for students. <br></br><br></br>
                    So, the motivation for our project came from that it has been made for that purpose, and for trying hardly to achieve all the previous goals.
                  
                   <b>Objective:</b><br></br>
                   <p>To build a responsive Mobile/website to manage the different school activities. 
                    To track student’s grades from their parents. 
                    To facilitate distribution process of courses and classes for teachers. 
                    To facilitate grades entry process for students by teachers. 
                    To make a virtual community between the members of educational process.</p><br></br>
                    <b>Scope and Limitation of the Project:</b><br></br><br></br>
                      <p><b>SMS</b> has been designed to provide an easy way for respective state students in <b>ABC Location</b> - to get their grades, and for their parents to be familiar with that grades and the academic achievement for their kids .<br />
                         However, this project may face some obstacles which is deny it from achievement it’s goals.<br></br>
                         like lack of acceptance these idea from some teachers and Management, because of their poor knowledge about using that technology or they find that using computers in their works instead of the paper works so hard and difficult. And also, the same thing for some parents where they do not prefer that way for the same previous reasons.
                      <br></br><br></br>
                       <b>Contribution:</b><br></br><br></br>
                     We went to a near High school in Hyderabad and got some requirements that helped us in our system, and we found solutions for problems that faced them.</p>
